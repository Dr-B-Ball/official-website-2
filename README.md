- "ABOUT US" section: change profile font; don't make it too fancy/hard to see; just make it more interesting; it is too plain/boring (Tyler)
- "HOME" section: replace "We hope to be an inspiration to children in younger generations so they can become involved in science, programming, and engineering." with "We hope to be an inspiration to children in future generations, so that they can be more involved in science, programming, and engineering."

- "HOME" section: IN THE NEAR FUTURE, TAKE AWAY THE STUFF REFERENCING THE OLD WEBSITE; THERE IS NO CLEAR REASON TO LEAVE IT THERE ON THE HOME PAGE (Tyler)
- "OUTREACH" section: you don't need to make "HERE!" in "Contact us by clicking Here!" a larger font; you can still leave it underlined; just make the font size the same for the whole sentence (Tyler)
- "What's FTC?" section: in the top bar, it is labeled as "What's FTC?", but in the title of the section when going to that section is "What is FTC?"; MAKE SURE THAT THE TITLES AND THE TITLES OF THE TOP BAR MATCH FOR THIS SPECIFIC SECTION (Tyler)

- THE ENTIRE WEBSITE: change font into more interesting font; too boring/repetitive; it will make the website much more appealing (Tyler)

other than that, everything is great (Tyler)
